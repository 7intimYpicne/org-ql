Tajweed is the science and art of reciting the Quran with proper pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm. It is a set of rules and guidelines that govern the correct way of reciting the Quran. Tajweed ensures that each letter, word, and verse is pronounced accurately, maintaining the integrity and beauty of the Quranic text.
 
According to **Quran Spirit**, study of Tajweed involves learning the correct pronunciation of Arabic letters and their characteristics, and mastering the rules of elongation, pausing, Qalaqaha, etc.
 
Qalqalah is an Arabic word that means shaking or vibration, and in tajweed, it refers to the echoing or bouncing sound produced in certain Arabic letters when they are in a state of Sukoon. These letters are known as the Qalqalah letters, and they include **ق (Qaf), ط (ta), ب (ba), ج (jeem)**, and **د (dal)**. Qalqalah is also applied in those letters when they come at the end of a word and the reciter stops recitation at this point.
 
This rule occurs when a noon sakin or **tanween** is followed by one of those Arabic letters **ي ، ر،. م، ل، و،** **ن** In this case, The noon sakin or tanween is merged or assimilated into the following letter without any separate pronunciation.
 
When applying this rule on the noon sakinah or tanween, the articulation point (makhraj) for noon sakin or tanween shifts to near that of the hidden letter. So, the reciter makes the tip of his tongue slightly away from the gums of the upper teeth.
 
The rules of Meem Sakinah, are important in Tajweed to ensure the accurate and proper **Quran recitation**. These rules apply when a meem letter (م) is in the state of Succon (a diacritical mark indicating the absence of a vowel). There are three rules for the pronunciation of Meem Sakinah:
 
Prolongation, also known as Al Madd in Tajweed, refers to the elongation of specific letters or sounds in the recitation of the Quran. It adds beauty, rhythm, and emphasis to the recitation. There are five types of Madd but here we mention just three of them.

In conclusion, understanding and applying the rules of Tajweed is essential for reciting the Quran with accuracy, beauty, and reverence. Throughout this article, we have explored some of the different types of Tajweed, such as Qlaqalah, heavy and light letters, and MADD
 
These rules help to enhance the rhythm and melody of the recitation, allowing us to connect with the words of Allah profoundly. However, it is important to note that Tajweed is a vast and intricate field, requiring guidance from qualified teachers and consistent practice to truly master.

Not only does it beautify the recitation, but learning Tajweed also ensures the message is not distorted by mistake. Reciting without Tajweed could change the meaning of words as there are rules set in place to differentiate similar letters. Even incorrect elongations can alter the meaning.
 
Even beginners are rewarded when struggling to recite correctly! Learning how to recite beautifully also gives the added benefit of wanting to recite the Quran more frequently as it sounds pleasant to the ears. Most importantly, Allah will take note of the effort and time that his servant put in to recite His words even if they never obtain perfection.
 
One can still practice by themselves by recording the section they recite and listening to it alongside a professional reciter of the Quran (such as Sh. Mahmoud Khalil al-Husary, Mohammed Ayoub, or Mishary Alafasy). Anytime you want to practice or follow along, listening to professional reciters can help teach the correct pronunciation of letters and proper Tajweed rules.
 
Tajweed, from the onset, needs to be learned through hearing and practice to match the perfect recitation. The rules below are only here as a descriptor and one should seek out assistance. This article will only go through some of the more important rules at a broad level. One can use this as a guide as they learn the rules. Below are some definitions that will be used throughout the explanations:
 
**With Ghunnah**: If these letters [ي ن م و] are followed after a noon sakinah or tanween, then skip the ghunnah from the noon, but instead apply the ghunnah with the followed letter.
 
Ikhfaa applies to the remaining letters not mentioned [ ت ث ج د ذ س ش ص ض ط ظ ف ق ك ]. One should hide the noon sakinah or tanween but apply ghunnah. The level of ghunnah depends on the specific letter that is followed after. Adjust the lips and mouth as if you are about to pronounce the letter after the noon sakinah or tanween.
 
If a noon or a meem has shaddah, then pronounce a **2 beat ghunnah**. This is still applied when stopping on the letter. Careful not to extend the sound of the letter, but only the ghunnah.
 
Madd affects letters which the reciter needs to stretch longer than they usually would. The elongation differs depending on the situation and the symbol present. The length of the Madd is usually described by the number of harakat or beats. Each different sub-rule has its name, but to keep things clear and concise they are grouped by the number of beats instead. The names of all of the rules are provided in one of the referenced links.
 
When one of the Madd letters is connected to another letter not followed by a hamza or letter with sukoon, then elongate it for only two beats. This is referred to as the natural Madd. If a hamza precedes a Madd letter, then the prolongation is still only 2 beats.
 
If one stops at a word in which there is a Madd before the last letter, then one can exaggerate the Madd to four or six beats. Two beats is still the minimum required here and one can do the elongation to four or six only if they stop at the word.
 
If there is a Madd letter in the middle of a word and a hamza follows it, the Madd should be prolonged by four or five beats. Similarly, if the word ends in a Madd and the beginning of the next word starts with a hamza, then the Madd should again be prolonged by four or five beats.
 
This article gives a summary of what Tajweed is and the benefits regarding it. There are still many nuances to Tajweed that were not explained in this discussion, so keep learning! Listening is one of the best ways to learn as that is how the Quran was originally spread. One can learn Tajweed without ever learning the names of the rules, by just having someone repeatedly correct their recitation. Allah has provided the ummah knowledge at their fingertips, so take advantage of this technological age!

Tajweed is the science that teaches how to read the Quran beautifully and without mistakes by observing the Makhraj and characteristics of the Quranic letters and following the rules of tajweed. The purpose of Tajweed is to protect the language from mistakes while reciting the Quran. Among the main topics covered in this science are:
 
Another factor that makes Tajweed rules necessary is that the language of the Quran is Arabic. Therefore, it should be read in accordance with the characteristics of this language. Since the Quran must be read according to certain rules, Tajweed, which is a kind of sum of these rules, is an integral part of the Quran recitation.
 
It is a fact that human nature always tends to do it in the most beautiful way, it tends to read in a way that touches the heart and heals the soul. It makes people feel awe, and this makes the worship beautiful.
 
In the time of the Prophet, there was no reason for people to learn the Quran with Tajweed. Because then, Tajweed rules that wanted to be learned now were part of their language. With the spread of Islam, those whose mother tongue is not Arabic began to learn the science of Tajweed with some rules in order to pronounce the Quran in the most correct way and not to disturb the meaning pattern. Today, Muslims from all over the world strive to learn this science, both in Quran courses and online Quran lessons.
 
Since the Quran was sent down with its wording and meaning, it is Fard Kifayah to learn Tajweed in order to preserve its wording in its original form. Accordingly, it is sufficient for some Muslims to know the rules of tajweed. Those who know receive their reward, but those who do not know do not become sinners.
 
However, it has been deemed Wajib to follow the rules of tajweed while reciting the Quran in a way that avoids the clear mistakes, which occur when the letters in the verses we recite in prayer, especially in prayer, are corrupted.
